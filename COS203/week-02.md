## Predicate Logic

Predicate Logic is an extension of Propositional Logic. Propositional Logic deals with whole statements like:
- "It is raining" → True or False
- "2 + 2 = 4" → True
- "Lagos is in Nigeria" → True

But what if we want to talk about properties of objects or relationships between objects? That's where Predicate Logic comes in.

### Predicate
A predicate is like a function that describes a property of an object.
**Format:** P(x) where:
- P = the predicate (the property)
- x = the variable (the object)

#### Examples:
Example 1:
- P(x) = "x is a prime number"
- If x = 5, then P(5) is True (5 is prime)
- If x = 4, then P(4) is False (4 is not prime)

Example 2:
- S(x) = "x is a student"
- If x = John, then S(John) could be True
- If x = a dog, then S(dog) is False

Example 3:
- E(x) = "x is even"
- If x = 6, then E(6) is True
- If x = 7, then E(7) is False

### Predicates with More Than One Variable
Some statements involve relationships between objects:
**Format:** R(x, y) where both x and y are variables

#### Examples:
Example 1:
- L(x, y) = "x loves y"
- If x = Alice and y = Bob, then L(Alice, Bob) could be True or False depending on reality

Example 2:
- G(x, y) = "x is greater than y"
- G(5, 3) is True
- G(2, 7) is False

Example 3:
- F(x, y) = "x is the father of y"
- F(John, Mary) could be True

### Quantifiers
In Predicate Logic, we need a way to talk about all objects or some objects. That's done with quantifiers. There are two main quantifiers:

#### Universal Quantifier (∀)
