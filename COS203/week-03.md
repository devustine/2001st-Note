## Understanding Sets and Their Properties

### What is a Set?
A set is simply a collection of distinct objects. Think of it like a bag or a box containing things, but with no duplicates allowed.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Unordered:** The order doesn't matter. {1, 2, 3} is the same as {3, 1, 2}
- **Distinct:** No duplicates. {1, 1, 2, 3} is just written as {1, 2, 3}
- **Well-defined:** It must be clear what's in the set and what's not

### Notation
Sets are usually written with:
- Capital letters: A, B, C, X, Y, Z
- Curly braces: { }

Elements (members) are written with:
- Lowercase letters: a, b, c, x, y, z
- Symbol ∈ means "is an element of"
- Symbol ∉ means "is not an element of"

Examples:
- A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
- B = {apple, banana, orange}
- C = {red, blue, green}

If 2 is in set A, we write: 2 ∈ A (read as "2 is an element of A"). If 7 is not in set A, we write: 7 ∉ A (read as "7 is not an element of A")
