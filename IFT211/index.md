## Information Representation and Number Base System

### What is Information Representation?

Information Representation is the method or technique used to store, display, and process information inside a computer or any digital system.

**What Humans Understand:**
- Letters: A, B, C, Z
- Numbers: 1, 2, 3, 100
- Symbols: @, #, ₦, %

But computers do NOT understand letters, numbers, or symbols directly like humans do. Computers ONLY understand:
- 0 (zero)
- 1 (one)

These two symbols (0 and 1) are called binary digits or bits (short for binary digit).
