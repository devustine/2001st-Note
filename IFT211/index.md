## Information Representation and Number Base System

### What is Information Representation?

Information representation is how we express and store data in different forms that computers and humans can understand. Computers work with electricity (ON/OFF), so they need a special way to represent numbers, letters, and symbols.

Everything in a computer (numbers, text, images, sound) is ultimately stored as patterns of 0s and 1s.

### Why Do We Need Different Representations?
Humans naturally use decimal (base 10) because we have 10 fingers. But computers use binary (base 2) because they work with electrical signals that are either ON (1) or OFF (0).

Other number systems like octal (base 8) and hexadecimal (base 16) are used as shortcuts to make binary numbers easier for humans to read and write.

### What is a Number Base?
A number base (or radix) is the number of unique digits used to represent numbers in a positional number system.

**Positional number system:** The position of a digit determines its value.

Example in decimal: 523
- 5 is in the hundreds place (5 × 100 = 500)
- 2 is in the tens place (2 × 10 = 20)
- 3 is in the ones place (3 × 1 = 3)
- Total: 500 + 20 + 3 = 523
