## Information Representation and Number Base System

### What is Information Representation?

Information Representation is the method or technique used to store, display, and process information inside a computer or any digital system.

**What Humans Understand:**
- Letters: A, B, C, Z
- Numbers: 1, 2, 3, 100
- Symbols: @, #, ₦, %

But computers do NOT understand letters, numbers, or symbols directly like humans do. Computers ONLY understand:
- 0 (zero)
- 1 (one)

These two symbols (0 and 1) are called binary digits or bits (short for binary digit).

| Type of Data | What You See | What Computer Stores |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Text        | "Hello"     | 01001000 01100101 ... |
| Numbers     | 25          | 0011001              |
| Images      | 🖼️ Photo    | Millions of 0s and 1s |
| Sound       | 🎵 Music    | Streams of 0s and 1s |
| Video       | 🎬 Movie    | Billions of 0s and 1s |

This entire conversion process is called **Information Representation**

### Why Computers Use Binary (0 and 1)
This comes from the field of Digital Logic and Electronics. Inside Every Computer, electronic circuits use transistors (tiny switches) and this these transistors have only two states "OFF" and "ON".

| State | Meaning                  | Voltage Level        | Binary Representation |
|-------|--------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| OFF   | No electricity flowing   | 0 volts (LOW)        | 0                     |
| ON    | Electricity flowing      | +5 volts (HIGH)      | 1                     |
